# BucketYourDream

Finally you can store all the things you ever wanted to do in one spot. Create your own bucket list and get an overview of all the dreams you still have. The application will allow you to also store already fulfilled dreams in your memory bucket, so you can always look back on all the wonderful, exciting things you have already accomplished.

Add a due date to your dreams to keep yourself accountable to reach your goals.

## Ideas for future iterations

In a future iteration I would like to add the functionality to add serveral users to access the same bucket list. This way couples could create their personal relationship goals.
